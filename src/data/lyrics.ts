    lyrics: [`
When we were younger in the thunder of the coming age
Said our goodbyes in the pouring rain
Hung up on a second thought
Praying that we’re never caught`,`

Quiet conversations with the ghost of the high life
The reputation let me down in the midnight
Back in that place again
Dreaming of what might’ve been`,

`If I make it through and wake up tomorrow
Grab the future, come and catch it ‘cause it’s going away`,

`I don’t want to hold on
No I don’t want to hold on, too tight
Feels like I’m nearly gone
Did we know it all along
Yeah, we’re going away`,

`The leaves had started changing it was gonna be a good one
But by November I was already done
Can’t wait until the winter comes
Then begging for the summer sun`,

`If I make it through and wake up tomorrow
Grab the future, come and catch it ‘cause it’s going away`,

`I don’t want to hold on
No I don’t want to hold on, too tight
Feels like I’m nearly gone
Did we know it all along
Yeah, we’re going away`,

`Hear the sound getting louder and louder
Gather round, gotta catch it because it’s going away
Look around have we found what we’re after`,

`Hear the sound getting louder and louder
Gather round, gotta catch it because it’s going away
Look around have we found what we’re after`,

`I don’t want to hold on
No I don’t want to hold on, too tight
Feels like I’m nearly gone
Did we know it all along
Yeah, we’re going away`,

`I don’t want to hold on
No I don’t want to hold on, too tight
Feels like I’m nearly gone
Did we know it all along
Yeah, we’re going away`]}]

// Even If We Don’t Know
// Renting this old house on the edge of town, I feel it
// The pressure’s building, gotta make it through the ceiling
// Sitting on the front porch, on a thrifted sofa, talking
// What are we doing
// Is it worth it
// Always keeping up

// Up up and away we’re going
// Will it last, raise a glass to hoping

// We’re gonna stay together
// We’re gonna change together
// Even if we don’t know
// No matter what comes tomorrow
// Into the night I’ll follow
// Even if we don’t know

// All of those letters, saying no, we still don’t want you
// Weighing my options
// Keep it open
// Searching for proof
// Waiting on my stamp of approval
// Give me a name
// But fame is not a virtue that will save you from finally waking up

// Up up and away we’re going
// Will it last, raise a glass to hoping

// We’re gonna stay together
// We’re gonna change together
// Even if we don’t know
// No matter what comes tomorrow
// Into the night I’ll follow
// Even if we don’t know

// Would we be missing out
// If we woke up on the other side
// If all we get is now
// Do we know these are the best of times

// Would we be missing out
// If we woke up on the other side
// If all we get is now
// Do we know these are the best of times

// We’re gonna stay together
// We’re gonna change together
// Even if we don’t know
// No matter what comes tomorrow
// Into the night I’ll follow
// Even if we don’t know

// We’re gonna stay together
// We’re gonna change together
// Even if we don’t know
// No matter what comes tomorrow
// Into the night I’ll follow
// Even if we don’t know
// Golden Company
// Golden company is coming for you, don’t forget it
// If you’re ahead or behind when you quit makes no difference
// Your compass doesn’t always point north
// As if you even had a choice
// What to follow

// You can be the villain, hero, or hide in the tower
// If you’re the one with the pen, then you hold all the power
// All your best might not be enough
// Insufficient funds is a tough pill to swallow

// Don’t stop no matter if you want to
// Sit tight, you’re closer than you know it
// Closer can you feel it
// Don’t stop no matter if you want to
// Sit tight, you’re closer than you know it
// Closer can you feel it

// Turn the tv on and wave to the time as it passes
// Come along for the ride, there’s still room in the wagon
// The room is not divided in two
// Offensive, old or shiny brand new
// Don’t reduce it

// Don’t stop no matter if you want to
// Sit tight, you’re closer than you know it
// Closer can you feel it
// Don’t stop no matter if you want to
// Sit tight, you’re closer than you know it
// Closer can you feel it
// Hold on Tonight
// I can’t stay home on a friday night
// My heart rate starts to rise
// I walk into the room and your eyes lock with mine
// I’ve got a feeling, I’ve got a feeling

// Smash the clock and the walk and watch it fall
// So tonight will never end
// Can’t control where my mind is going
// I cannot pretend
// I’ve got a feeling, I’ve got a feeling

// Could you lie to me
// Promise me we’ll both be young forever
// Don’t hide from me
// Promise me we’ll always stay together
// Young forever

// We don’t know for sure
// We don’t know for sure about tomorrow
// So hold on tonight
// We don’t know for sure
// We don’t know for sure about tomorrow
// So hold on tonight

// You keep leading me around like
// I’ve got no place else to go
// But lay down all the world before me
// I’ll keep coming home
// I’ve got a feeling, I’ve got a feeling

// You say it’s treason if I ever loved
// Another just the same
// But your reason falls apart because
// You love to play the game
// I’ve got a feeling, I’ve got a feeling

// Could you lie to me
// Promise me we’ll both be young forever
// Don’t hide from me
// Promise me we’ll always stay together
// Young forever


// We don’t know for sure
// We don’t know for sure about tomorrow
// So hold on tonight
// We don’t know for sure
// We don’t know for sure about tomorrow
// So hold on tonight

// You say it’s treason if I ever loved
// Another just the same
// But your reason falls apart because
// You love to play the game
// I’ve got a feeling, I’ve got a feeling

// Could you lie to me
// Promise me we’ll both be young forever
// Don’t hide from me
// Promise me we’ll always stay together
// Young forever


// We don’t know for sure
// We don’t know for sure about tomorrow
// So hold on tonight
// We don’t know for sure
// We don’t know for sure about tomorrow
// So hold on tonight

// Cheap Talk
// Is everybody feeling the same
// Nobody’s winning but we play the game
// I can’t admit it, but I need a change
// Cause it’s too easy to stay this way
// Yeah it’s too easy to stay this way

// Loose lips
// Cheap talk
// Run forever
// Run forever
// Breath in
// Don’t stop
// Run forever
// Run forever

// Let’s settle down now
// Give it a try
// You may be clever but you’re wasting time
// A bit a sugar keeps the medicine down
// Maybe we better color in the lines
// But I don’t wanna color in the lines

// Loose lips
// Cheap talk
// Run forever
// Run forever
// Breath in
// Don’t stop
// Run forever
// Run forever

// Loose lips
// Cheap talk
// Run forever
// Run forever
// Breath in
// Don’t stop
// Run forever
// Run forever
// Can’t Keep Doing This
// I woke up on an island
// The sun was blinding in my eyes
// I looked around for shelter
// But there was nowhere I could hide

// My memory was hazy
// Cobwebs blowing in the breeze
// I summoned all my strength
// Just to get up on my knees

// Well the night was holding on
// I could barely catch my breath
// You walked up right behind me
// Whispered in my ear and said

// You know we can’t keep doing this
// Tell me we won’t keep doing this
// You said we can’t keep doing this
// No more

// You walked into the party
// With lips so red my blood ran cold
// I could have tried to fight it
// But this was out of my control

// Fifty people on the rooftop the bass was rattling my bones
// Two more drinks and I was ready
// Started reaching for my phone
// Hey, why don’t we take off
// Go do something we’ll regret
// You walked up right behind me
// Whispered in my ear and said

// You know we can’t keep doing this
// Tell me we won’t keep doing this
// You said we can’t keep doing this
// No more

// You tell me this is the last time
// But I remember the first time
// No matter how much I want to
// I just can’t let go

// You tell me this is the last time
// But I remember the first time
// No matter how much I want to
// I just can’t let go

// You know we can’t keep doing this
// Tell me we won’t keep doing this
// You said we can’t keep doing this
// No more

// You tell me this is the last time
// But I remember the first time
// No matter how much I want to
// I just can’t let go
// Misshapen Shadows
// I hope that you do not notice
// When the lights have gone out
// My eyes get darker
// It’s so much harder
// Did I let you down

// Lost focus for just one moment
// So far down off the path
// Somewhere deep in hiding
// Get struck by lightning
// Would it bring us back

// Open my eyes but I still can’t see
// Please wake me up from the in between
// Feeling defeated in my dreams
// Misshapen Shadows are following me

// Remember when we were children
// Standing up at the front
// Anything could happen
// Let’s make it happen
// Now and for always

// I made a few bad decisions
// And the whole world went black
// Where can I find you
// Come to my rescue
// I’ve fallen into the trap

// Open my eyes but I still can’t see
// Please wake me up from the in between
// Feeling defeated in my dreams
// Misshapen Shadows are following me

// Yeah, they’re following me
// They’re following me
// Misshapen shadows are following me
// Yeah, they’re following me
// They’re following me
// Misshapen shadows are following me

// Where do I hide it
// When i want it the most
// I want it the most
// We keep pretending
// That nobody knows
// Yeah nobody knows

// Where do I hide it
// When i want it the most
// I want it the most
// We keep pretending
// That nobody knows
// Yeah nobody knows

// Where do I hide it
// When i want it the most
// I want it the most
// We keep pretending
// That nobody knows
// Yeah nobody knows

// Open my eyes but I still can’t see
// Please wake me up from the in between
// Feeling defeated in my dreams
// Misshapen Shadows are following me

// Yeah, they’re following me
// They’re following me
// Misshapen shadows are following me
// Yeah, they’re following me
// They’re following me
// Misshapen shadows are following me
// Borrowed Light
// Home alone and I’m wearing a path in the carpet on my bedroom floor
// I can feel myself going down
// But I wanna change it some how

// Took a drop off the edge and I’m halfway hoping that I don’t find more
// Free falling through space now
// Will I ever hit the ground

// Where’s the keys to the kingdom
// Would you tell me the reason
// Does it get any better
// I can’t hold it together

// Is there something between us
// A line that we can’t cross
// Under all of the pressure

// Darkness creeping up in the garden
// I can’t live in the borrowed light
// In the borrowed light
// Reckless standing out on your doorsteps
// I can’t live in the borrowed light
// In the borrowed light

// Waking up hear the world calling everyone hanging on my every word
// Keep it up so they don’t know
// Cover up so it won’t show
// Hit the gas hold on and it all flies by cause we never learn
// But we’ve got right now
// So maybe we should slow down

// Where’s the keys to the kingdom
// Would you tell me the reason
// Does it get any better
// I can’t hold it together

// Is there something between us
// A line that we can’t cross
// Under all of the pressure

// Darkness creeping up in the garden
// I can’t live in the borrowed light
// In the borrowed light
// Reckless standing out on your doorsteps
// I can’t live in the borrowed light
// In the borrowed light

// Darkness creeping up in the garden
// I can’t live in the borrowed light
// In the borrowed light
// Reckless standing out on your doorsteps
// I can’t live in the borrowed light
// In the borrowed light

// Santa Ana
// I feel you Santa Ana
// I know you’re coming we can’t get away
// Have mercy Santa Ana
// Red skies above are begging for the rain

// Rosary, round my neck
// Mary can you hear me now as I confess
// My regrets
// Come and grant me pardon

// Tiny beads, on my knees
// I can keep on praying, but the past is set
// Can’t forget
// Locked out of the garden

// But I can’t talk I’ve got blood in my mouth
// And a ghost in the house
// He won’t leave me
// Santa Ana winds keep blowing around
// Pushing me to the edge
// Of a breakdown

// But I can keep on holding on, holding on, holding on
// For a little while
// Yes, I can keep on holding on, holding on, holding on
// For a little while

// Catch on the word is spreading
// They said the world was ending yesterday
// Look up the sky is falling
// Down here we keep on dancing for the rain


// Rosary, round my neck
// Mary can you hear me now as I confess
// My regrets
// Come and grant me pardon

// Tiny beads, on my knees
// I can keep on praying, but the past is set
// Can’t forget

// The Funeral
// I don’t wanna move away
// But I’ll go if you ask me to
// Anywhere you ask me to

// Will you tell me what to say
// On the day we know
// Is coming to soon
// Yeah, it’s coming to soon

// Late at night sneaking into the service
// Gonna sit on the back row
// Pray for no one to notice
// Close my eyes and ask for mercy
// Did you finally let go
// Did you let go of me

// The funeral that tied us together
// The year the winter lasted forever
// And the tears freezing on your cheeks
// Between the words that we didn’t speak
// And on the days that I could barely breathe
// You held me close, you held me closer

// I’m getting older
// But I don’t know if I’m doing it right
// Am I doing right
// Waking up my mind is racing
// Am I doing right
// Am I doing right

// Call my parents everyday
// While I still can
// Their days are slipping through my fingers
// Listen to the message that I left you
// On your machine
// I was afraid that I could lose you

// The funeral that tied us together
// The year the winter lasted forever
// And the tears freezing on your cheeks
// Between the words that we didn’t speak
// And on the days that I could barely breathe
// You held me close, you held me closer

// I’m getting older
// But I don’t know if I’m doing it right
// Am I doing right
// Waking up my mind is racing
// Am I doing right
// Am I doing right

// I’m getting older
// But I don’t know if I’m doing it right
// Am I doing right
// Waking up my mind is racing
// Am I doing right
// Am I doing right

// When I look into your eyes
// I could start a war
// Don’t you know this is the moment
// We’ve been waiting for

// When I look into your eyes
// I could start a war
// Don’t you know this is the moment
// We’ve been waiting for

// I’m getting older
// But I don’t know if I’m doing it right
// Am I doing right
// Waking up my mind is racing
// Am I doing right
// Am I doing right

// I’m getting older
// But I don’t know if I’m doing it right
// Am I doing right
// Waking up my mind is racing
// Am I doing right
// Am I doing right

// Don’t close her eyes
// Whatcha gonna find is there’s still time
// Chin up now
// Don’t draw that line

// Can you say what the future holds
// I don’t know

// All of the pieces that I can’t control
// Can I let them go

// Crashing like waves to break my bones
// Can I hold on

// Don’t fence me in
// All this time that I’ve been hiding
