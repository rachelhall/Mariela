        >Rachel Hall is a singer-songwriter and producer who performs under the
        name Mariela. Her original music is characterized by introspective
        melancholy lyrics about personal discovery, and religious trauma
        packaged in catchy melodies with big guitars and soaring synth hooks.</Text

        She’s currently releasing singles from her upcoming album that explores
        the loss of her marriage and the way that self-actualization has put a
        strain on her relationships with her family of origin. Her latest
        single, Moriah, explores the similarities between the biblical story,
        “The binding of Isaac on Mt. Moriah” to the way evangelical parents
        relate to their queer children.</Text

        Rachel also produces for many artists in the San Diego music scene and
        backs a number of artists as a keyboard, guitar, and bass player.</Text
